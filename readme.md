# A* Algorithm and Maze generation.

This project is a visualization of the Prim maze generation and the A* path finding algorithms in C++ using the SFML library.

# Controls/ How to


* Press 0 1 or 2 on the keyboard to switch drawing modes. 

* Pressing 0 will allow you to draw a starting node thats colored green. Only one starting node can be on screen so when if you draw it on another node the previous one will be removed.

* Pressing 1 will allow you to draw an end node. It works the same way as the starting node but its colored red.

* Pressing 2 will allow you to draw obstacles. These are colored black and mark which nodes will not be able to be visited by the algorithm. You can hold the mouse down to draw these.

* Holding the right mouse button in any of these modes allows you to erase nodes.

* Pressing ESC will clear the whole screen.

* Once a start and end node are set pressing ENTER will begin the algorithm. The algorithm will color the nodes its searching in yellow and once it finds a path it will be colored in blue.

* You can press SPACE to generate a maze.
